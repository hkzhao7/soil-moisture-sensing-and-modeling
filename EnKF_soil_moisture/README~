PFLOTRAN files

* This is for running a 1D vadose-zone flow simulation with one rain event.  

- pflotran.in: PFLOTRAN input file

= Subfiles
- E1_regions_grid.txt: define all the grid blocks 
- E2_obs2grid.txt: define all the grid block locations
- E3_sink_dry.txt: define all a sink term in each grid block
- E4_sink2region.txt: assign sink terms on grid blocks
- E5_obs2initial.txt: define initial conditions 
- E6_initial2grid.txt: assign initial conditions on grid blocks
- rainfall_v1.txt: defines the rain rate over time (PFLOTRAN boundary condition format)
- T_v1.txt: defines the tranpiration rate over time (PFLOTRAN boundary condition format)

= Write subfiles
- et2sink.py: write E3_sink_dry.txt
- et2sink_lim.py: write E3_sink_dry.txt
- F_root_fraction.py: define the root distribution called by write_sink_root.py


= Run script
- master.py: “python master.py” runs the simulations

= Output
- pflotran-obs-0.tec: output of time series of pressure and saturation at each grid block. Each row is {time, pressure1, saturation1, pressure2, saturation2, pressure3, saturation3, ….}
