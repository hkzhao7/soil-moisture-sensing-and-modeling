PFLOTRAN files

* This is for running EnKF a 1D vadose-zone flow simulation with one rain event.  

= master files
- master_Tvaries.py: creates synthetic time series of soil moisture data
- masterEnKF0727.py: estimates the soil moisture based on the synthetic data

= Subfiles
- E1_regions_grid.txt: define all the grid blocks 
- E2_obs2grid.txt: define all the grid block locations
- E3_sink_dry.txt: define all a sink term in each grid block
- E4_sink2region.txt: assign sink terms on grid blocks
- E5_obs2initial.txt: define initial conditions 
- E6_initial2grid.txt: assign initial conditions on grid blocks
- rainfall_v1.txt: defines the rain rate over time (PFLOTRAN boundary condition format)
- T_v1.txt: defines the tranpiration rate over time (PFLOTRAN boundary condition format)

= Write subfiles
- et2sink.py: write E3_sink_dry.txt
- et2sink_lim.py: write E3_sink_dry.txt
- F_root_fraction.py: define the root distribution called by write_sink_root.py
- rain2window.py: assign the rain/precipitation rate within the time window
- Tseries2T.py: assign the traspiration	rate within the	time window
- obsread.py: reads pressure values from pflotran-obs-0.tec
- pres2initial.py: assign different initial pressure conditions at the grid blocks
- Kalman_functions.py: defines various functions necessary for EnKF
- pres_theta.py: converts theta to pressure or pressure to theta

= pflotran input files
- pf_initia.in: runs from the uniform initial conditions
- pf_seq.in: runs from the non-uniform initial conditions (diffferent values at grid blocks)
